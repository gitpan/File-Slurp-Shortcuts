NAME
    File::Slurp::Shortcuts - Several shortcut functions for File::Slurp

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     # instead of 'use File::Slurp', you 'use File::Slurp::Shortcuts' instead
     use File::Slurp::Shortcuts qw(slurp_cq ...);
     my $email   = slurp_cq('/home/user1/etc/email');
     my @domains = slurp_cq('/home/user1/etc/domains');
     ...

DESCRIPTION
    File::Slurp::Shortcuts is a drop-in replacement for File::Slurp,
    offering more shortcut functions for convenience. It currently also adds
    autochomping to read_file().

    About autochomping: It is supposed to be in the upcoming version of
    File::Slurp, but since I'm tired of waiting, this module is the band-aid
    solution. It wraps read_file() (and slurp()) so it handles the chomp
    option. It reads in file containing, e.g. "foo\n" into Perl data as
    "foo".

FUNCTIONS
    For the complete list of functions available, see File::Slurp. Below are
    functions introduced by File::Slurp::Shortcuts:

  read_file_c($path, %opts) (or slurp_c)
    Shortcut for:

     read_file('path', chomp=>1, ...)

  read_file_cq($path, %opts) (or slurp_cq)
    Shortcut for:

     read_file('path', chomp=>1, err_mode=>'quiet', ...)

    I use this a lot to retrieve configuration value from files.

  read_file_q($path, %opts) (or slurp_q)
    Shortcut for:

     read_file('path', err_mode=>'quiet', ...)

    I use this a lot to read files that are optional.

SEE ALSO
    File::Slurp, obviously.
